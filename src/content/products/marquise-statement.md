## Marquise Statement Ring

Bold, dramatic, and impossibly elegant – this marquise-cut diamond makes an unforgettable statement. The 2.5-carat stone's elongated silhouette creates maximum visual impact, while the intricate 18K white gold mounting showcases artisan craftsmanship at its finest.

### The Marquise Cut Legacy

Legend attributes the marquise cut's creation to King Louis XIV of France, who commissioned a diamond shape to match the lips of his mistress, the Marquise de Pompadour. Whether myth or history, the marquise has remained a symbol of romance and sophistication for over 300 years.

### The Marquise Advantage

The marquise cut offers unique visual benefits:

1. **Size Illusion**: Appears larger than round diamonds of equal carat weight
2. **Finger Lengthening**: The elongated shape creates a flattering effect
3. **Brilliance**: Modified brilliant cut provides exceptional sparkle
4. **Distinction**: Less common than round cuts, offering uniqueness
5. **Versatility**: Elegant for both day and evening wear

### Diamond Quality Excellence

**Color Grade: E (Colorless)**
Only two grades below perfect D color, E-grade diamonds are exceptionally rare and valuable. The stone appears perfectly white with no detectable color, even when viewed from the side.

**Clarity Grade: VS1**
"Very Slightly Included 1" means inclusions are extremely difficult to see even under 10x magnification. To the naked eye, the diamond is flawless.

**Cut Excellence**
The marquise cut is one of the most challenging diamond shapes to cut properly. Our stone features:
- Optimal length-to-width ratio of 2:1
- Excellent symmetry (points perfectly aligned)
- Ideal depth for maximum brilliance
- No "bow-tie effect" (common in poorly cut marquise)

### Intricate Setting Design

The mounting showcases exceptional craftsmanship:

**Six-Prong Setting**
Marquise diamonds require six prongs for security – four along the sides and two protecting the delicate points. Our setting uses platinum-tipped prongs for maximum strength.

**Diamond Halo**
Twenty-four brilliant-cut diamonds surround the center stone, creating a luminous frame that enhances the marquise's dramatic shape.

**Vintage-Inspired Details**
The band features intricate scrollwork and milgrain detailing, adding texture and visual interest. These hand-finished details require hours of skilled work.

**Split Shank**
The band gracefully splits as it approaches the center stone, adding architectural interest and the illusion of additional diamonds.

### Craftsmanship Process

Creating this ring requires multiple artisan specialists:

1. **CAD Designer**: Creates precise 3D model
2. **Caster**: Casts the 18K white gold structure
3. **Stone Setter**: Precision-sets center diamond and halo
4. **Finisher**: Hand-polishes and adds milgrain details
5. **Quality Control**: Multi-point inspection process

Total creation time: 3-4 weeks per ring.

### Styling & Wearing
