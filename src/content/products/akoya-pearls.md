## Akoya Pearl Strand

A masterpiece of nature and craftsmanship, this Akoya pearl strand showcases the finest qualities of Japanese cultured pearls. Each pearl is hand-selected for its exceptional luster, perfectly matched size, and beautiful rose overtone.

### Heritage of Akoya Pearls

### Artisan Selection Process

Creating a perfectly matched strand takes time and expertise. Each pearl in this necklace has been individually selected from thousands to ensure uniform size, shape, color, and luster. The process can take weeks to assemble a flawless strand that meets our exacting standards.

### The Clasp

The hand-engraved 14K yellow gold clasp features a secure box mechanism with a safety figure-eight catch. Our artisan engravers add delicate floral motifs that complement the natural beauty of the pearls while ensuring the clasp is both functional and beautiful.

### Care Instructions

- **Wearing**: Put on last after applying cosmetics, perfume, and hairspray
- **Cleaning**: Wipe gently with a soft, damp cloth after each wear
- **Storage**: Store flat in a soft pouch, separate from other jewelry
- **Restringing**: Professional restringing recommended every 2-3 years

### Pearl Care Philosophy

"Pearls are living gems," as the saying goes. They require slightly more care than diamonds or colored stones, but with proper attention, your Akoya strand will maintain its beauty for generations. The natural nacre surface develops a deeper, richer luster over time with proper wear and care.
