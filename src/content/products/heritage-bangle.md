## Heritage Bangle

A celebration of Art Deco design and traditional goldsmith techniques, the Heritage Bangle is a statement piece that bridges past and present. Crafted from solid 18K yellow gold and adorned with hand-engraved geometric patterns, each bangle is a unique work of wearable art.

### Art Deco Inspiration

The 1920s Art Deco movement revolutionized jewelry design with its bold geometric patterns, clean lines, and celebration of craftsmanship. Our Heritage Bangle pays homage to this golden age of design while incorporating modern comfort and wearability.

### Master Engraver's Touch

Each Heritage Bangle passes through the skilled hands of our master engraver, who has practiced this rare art form for over 40 years. Using traditional hand-engraving tools, they create the intricate geometric pattern that adorns the bangle's surface. The process takes approximately 8-10 hours per piece, ensuring each bangle is truly one-of-a-kind.

### The Pattern

The engraved pattern features repeating geometric motifs inspired by Art Deco architecture and jewelry of the 1920s and 1930s. Chevrons, sunbursts, and stepped forms interlock in a rhythmic dance across the gold surface. The engraved areas are left with a subtle matte finish that contrasts beautifully with the high-polish gold surrounding them.

### Wearing & Styling

The Heritage Bangle makes a bold statement worn alone or can be stacked with other bangles for a more dramatic look. The 12mm width provides substantial presence on the wrist without sacrificing comfort. The hinged opening allows for easy on and off, while the secure clasp ensures worry-free wear.

**Styling Suggestions:**
- Pair with a cocktail ring for evening elegance
- Stack with thinner bangles in mixed metals for modern contrast
- Wear as an heirloom piece for special occasions
- Perfect with both contemporary and vintage-inspired wardrobes

### Care Instructions

- **Cleaning**: Wipe with a soft, lint-free cloth after wear
- **Deep Cleaning**: Soak in warm soapy water, gently brush engraved areas with a soft toothbrush
- **Polishing**: Professional polishing every 2-3 years to maintain high shine
