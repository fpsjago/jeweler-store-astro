## Royal Sapphire Pendant

A mesmerizing 3-carat Ceylon sapphire captures the essence of the sky at twilight, surrounded by a glittering halo of brilliant diamonds. This classic pendant design showcases the sapphire's legendary "royal blue" color in a setting worthy of its regal heritage.

### The Ceylon Sapphire

Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) has been the world's premier source of fine blue sapphires for over 2,000 years. Ceylon sapphires are prized for their pure, vivid blue color with excellent transparency. Unlike sapphires from some other sources, Ceylon stones exhibit a crystalline clarity that allows light to dance through the stone.

### The Royal Blue

The term "royal blue" refers to the most desirable sapphire color – a pure, vivid blue with medium to medium-dark tone and strong saturation. The sapphire in this pendant exhibits this coveted color with remarkable consistency throughout the stone. In different lighting conditions, you'll see subtle shifts from deep azure to brilliant cornflower blue.

### Halo Design Excellence

The diamond halo serves multiple design purposes:

1. **Magnification**: Optically enlarges the sapphire's appearance
2. **Brilliance**: Adds sparkle that complements the sapphire's color
3. **Protection**: Provides a buffer protecting the sapphire's edges
4. **Versatility**: Makes the piece suitable for both day and evening wear

### Platinum Setting

We chose platinum 950 for this setting for several important reasons:

- **Purity**: 95% pure platinum ensures hypoallergenic properties
- **Durability**: Platinum is incredibly strong and resistant to wear
- **Color**: The white metal enhances the sapphire's blue hue
- **Prestige**: Platinum is the most precious jewelry metal
- **Longevity**: Won't fade, tarnish, or require re-plating

### The Chain

The pendant hangs from a delicate platinum cable chain that's both elegant and durable. The adjustable length allows you to wear it at 16 or 18 inches, depending on your outfit and preference. A secure lobster clasp ensures peace of mind.

### Symbolism & Meaning

Throughout history, sapphires have symbolized:
- **Wisdom & Truth**: Worn by clergy and royalty
- **Faithfulness**: A traditional choice for engagement rings
- **Protection**: Believed to guard the wearer from envy and harm
- **Nobility**: Associated with royal families worldwide
