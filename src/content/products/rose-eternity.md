### Rose Gold Romance

Rose gold has experienced a renaissance in modern jewelry design. Created by alloying pure gold with copper, rose gold offers:

- **Warmth**: The pinkish hue complements all skin tones beautifully
- **Durability**: The copper alloy makes it slightly harder than yellow or white gold
- **Versatility**: Pairs beautifully with white, yellow gold, and platinum
- **Timelessness**: Both vintage-inspired and thoroughly modern

### Diamond Selection

Each diamond in your eternity band is carefully selected to ensure:

1. **Consistent Color**: Matched for uniform appearance
2. **Optimal Cut**: Brilliant cut for maximum sparkle
3. **Secure Setting**: Shared prong technique for durability
4. **Conflict-Free**: Ethically sourced with full documentation

### Shared Prong Setting

The shared prong setting technique allows diamonds to sit close together, creating the illusion of a continuous ribbon of light. Each diamond is held securely by prongs it shares with its neighbors, providing:

- **Maximum brilliance**: Less metal, more diamond visible
- **Secure hold**: Each stone is held by multiple prongs
- **Comfortable fit**: Smooth, low-profile design
- **Durability**: Engineered for everyday wear

### Sizing Considerations

**Important Note**: Full eternity bands (diamonds all the way around) are more difficult to resize than traditional rings. We offer several solutions:

1. **Precise Sizing**: We recommend professional sizing before purchase
2. **Partial Eternity Option**: Available with diamonds 3/4 around for easier resizing
3. **Sizing Insurance**: Included free within first 60 days
4. **Ring Sizing Guide**: Detailed instructions provided with purchase

### Wearing & Stacking

**Stacking Suggestions:**
