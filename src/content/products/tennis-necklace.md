## Diamond Tennis Necklace

The ultimate expression of timeless luxury: sixty brilliant-cut diamonds of exceptional quality, each precisely matched and set in platinum. This iconic tennis necklace delivers breathtaking brilliance that circles the neck with uninterrupted radiance.

### The Tennis Necklace Legacy

The term "tennis necklace" entered popular culture in 1987 when tennis champion Chris Evert's diamond line bracelet broke during a match at the U.S. Open. Since then, these continuous diamond necklaces have become synonymous with understated luxury and timeless elegance.

**Cut Grade: Excellent**

### Precision Matching

Creating a flawless tennis necklace requires exceptional skill and patience. Each of the 60 diamonds must be:

1. **Size-matched**: Within 0.01ct of adjacent stones
2. **Color-matched**: Identical color grade throughout
3. **Cut-matched**: Uniform depth and proportions
4. **Brilliance-matched**: Consistent sparkle and fire

Our gemologists evaluate hundreds of diamonds to assemble a perfectly matched set for each necklace. The process can take weeks to achieve the seamless flow of light this piece exhibits.

### Platinum Setting

The necklace is crafted in platinum 950, chosen for its exceptional properties:

- **Purity**: 95% pure platinum ensures lasting beauty

- **Prestige**: The most precious jewelry metal
- **Reflection**: Enhances diamond brilliance with its bright white color

The necklace features a sophisticated double-security clasp system:

1. **Main Clasp**: Platinum box clasp with spring mechanism
2. **Safety Latch**: Figure-eight safety catch
3. **Easy Operation**: Secure yet simple to fasten
4. **Peace of Mind**: Redundant security for valuable pieces

### Setting Technique

Each diamond is set in an individual four-prong basket setting. This technique offers:

- **Security**: Four prongs hold each stone firmly
- **Flexibility**: Necklace moves naturally with body
- **Brilliance**: Maximum light exposure from all angles
- **Durability**: Each setting is independently secure
