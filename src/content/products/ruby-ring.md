## Burmese Ruby Ring

A magnificent 3.2-carat Burmese ruby of exceptional "pigeon's blood" color commands attention in this Art Deco-inspired platinum setting. Flanked by baguette-cut diamonds that echo 1920s geometric elegance, this ring is a masterpiece of both nature and design.

### The Legend of Burmese Rubies

For centuries, the mines of Myanmar (Burma) have produced the world's most coveted rubies. The term "pigeon's blood" describes the finest color – a pure, vivid red with subtle blue undertones. These rubies are so rare and valuable that they often command higher prices per carat than diamonds.

### Pigeon's Blood Color

The term "pigeon's blood" originated in Burma centuries ago, describing the finest ruby color possible:

**What It Means:**
- Pure, vivid red with slight blue undertones
- Medium to medium-dark tone
- Strong saturation with no brown or orange
- Exceptional fluorescence under UV light

**Why It's Rare:**
Only about 1% of Burmese rubies qualify for this designation. The combination of chromium content, crystal structure, and geological conditions required to create this color occurs in very few locations worldwide.

**Value Impact:**
Pigeon's blood rubies command premium prices – often 20-50% more than other fine rubies. Large stones over 3 carats with this color are exceptionally rare and increasingly valuable.

### Burmese vs. Other Rubies

**Burmese Rubies:**
- Pure red color with blue undertones
- Exceptional fluorescence (glows under UV)
- Fine crystal structure
- Legendary origin with centuries of history

**Other Origins:**
- Thai rubies: Often too dark or brownish
- African rubies: Can be good but lack fluorescence
- Lab-created: No natural fluorescence or value

### The Art Deco Setting

The 1920s Art Deco period revolutionized jewelry design with geometric patterns and architectural inspiration. This ring pays homage to that golden age:

**Design Elements:**
- **Three-Stone Format**: Center ruby flanked by diamond baguettes
- **Step-Cut Shoulders**: Additional baguettes create geometric pattern
- **Platinum Mounting**: Period-appropriate metal choice
- **Clean Lines**: Emphasis on geometry and symmetry
- **Low Profile**: Elegant, wearable height

**Baguette Diamonds:**
The 12 baguette-cut diamonds total 0.80 carats of exceptional quality:
- Step-cut facets echo Art Deco style
- F-G color matches platinum's whiteness
- VS clarity ensures transparency
- Hand-selected for uniform appearance

### Platinum Setting

Platinum 950 was chosen for multiple important reasons:

**Technical Superiority:**
- Strongest precious metal for secure stone settings
- Naturally white – never needs re-plating
- Hypoallergenic and gentle on skin
- Extremely dense and durable

**Aesthetic Excellence:**
- Enhances ruby's red color through contrast
- Complements diamond brilliance
- Ages beautifully with soft patina
- Period-appropriate for Art Deco design

**Investment Value:**
- 95% pure platinum content
- Most precious jewelry metal
- Platinum jewelry maintains excellent resale value

### The Center Ruby Setting

The 3.2-carat oval ruby is set using advanced techniques:

**Prong Setting:**
- Four platinum prongs secure the ruby
- Prongs positioned at cardinal points
- Allows maximum light entry
- Secure yet elegant

**Undergallery:**
- Open back allows light through stone
- Platinum framework provides structural support
- Hand-finished details throughout

### Heat Treatment Note

Like 95% of rubies worldwide, this stone has been heated – a traditional practice dating back centuries:

**What It Means:**
- Stone was heated to 1600-1800°C
- Enhances color and clarity
- Permanent and stable treatment
- Fully disclosed and industry standard

**Why It's Accepted:**
- Traditional practice for over 1,000 years
- Doesn't affect durability or longevity
- Universally accepted in fine jewelry
- Disclosed on all certificates

**Value:**
Unheated rubies of this quality would cost 2-3x more and are nearly impossible to find in sizes over 2 carats.

### Wearing & Styling

**Cocktail Ring Excellence:**
This is a true cocktail ring – meant to be noticed:
- Perfect for formal events and galas
- Stunning dinner and theater piece
- Wear on ring finger or middle finger

**Daytime Confidence:**
Despite its size, the elegant design allows daytime wear:

**Color Pairing:**
The ruby's red works beautifully with:
- Black for classic elegance
- White for clean sophistication

- Jewel tones for evening drama

### Care Instructions

Rubies are extremely durable (9 on Mohs scale, second only to diamonds):

**Daily Wear:**
- Safe for everyday wear and activities
- Remove during heavy manual work
- Avoid impacts (though rubies are very tough)

**Cleaning:**
- Warm soapy water and soft brush
- Ultrasonic cleaning safe
- Professional cleaning recommended annually
- Avoid harsh chemicals

**Professional Maintenance:**
- Annual prong inspection recommended

### Sizing & Fit

**Current Size:** 6 (most common women's size)

**Resizing Options:**
- Available in sizes 4-9
- Quarter and half sizes available
- Professional sizing included with purchase
- Complex resizing due to baguettes (see note below)

**Resizing Note:**
Because of the baguette diamonds extending down the shoulders, resizing is more complex than standard rings. We can resize approximately 1.5 sizes up or down from size 6. Larger adjustments may require reconstruction.
