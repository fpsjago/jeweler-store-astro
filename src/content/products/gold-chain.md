## Classic Gold Necklace

Timeless elegance meets substantial luxury in this classic 18K gold cable chain. The 4mm width creates presence without overwhelming, while the 20-inch length offers versatile styling options. Hand-finished to perfection, this is the gold chain that belongs in every jewelry collection.
