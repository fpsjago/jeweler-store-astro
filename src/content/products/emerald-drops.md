## Emerald Drop Earrings

Exquisite Colombian emeralds of extraordinary color cascade from diamond-studded 18K white gold settings. These elongated drop earrings frame the face with timeless elegance, capturing light with every movement.

### The Colombian Emerald Legacy

Colombia produces the world's finest emeralds, renowned for their pure, vivid green color and exceptional clarity. The emeralds in these earrings come from the legendary Muzo mining region, where the finest stones have been treasured for over 500 years.

### Specifications

|---------|---------|

| **Emerald Grade** | Vivid green, excellent clarity |
| **Metal** | 18K white gold, rhodium-plated |
| **Diamonds** | 0.40ct total, VS quality |
| **Drop Length** | 1.5 inches from ear lobe |
| **Setting** | Four-prong with diamond crown |
| **Backs** | Secure friction posts with comfort backs |

### Color & Clarity

The emeralds in these earrings exhibit the highly coveted "Colombian green" – a pure, vivid green with subtle bluish undertones. Unlike emeralds from other sources, Colombian stones have minimal secondary color, resulting in the clearest, most vibrant green possible. The exceptional clarity allows light to penetrate deep into the stone, creating a mesmerizing glow.

### Design Excellence

The elongated drop design serves multiple purposes: it elongates the neck, draws the eye upward toward the face, and allows the emeralds to catch light from every angle. The diamond-studded crown adds brilliant sparkle that complements the emerald's verdant glow.

### Artisan Setting

Each emerald is precision-set using the four-prong technique, which provides security while allowing maximum light exposure. Our master setters use white gold prongs that are rhodium-plated to enhance the emerald's green color through contrast.

### The Diamond Accent

Brilliant-cut diamonds totaling 0.40 carats encircle the top of each emerald, creating a luminous crown. The diamonds are carefully matched for color (F-G) and clarity (VS), ensuring they complement rather than compete with the emerald's beauty.

### Wearing & Occasion

These earrings are versatile enough for both day and evening wear:

**Daytime Elegance:**
- Perfect with a crisp white shirt and tailored jacket
- Adds sophistication to casual-chic ensembles
- Ideal for business meetings requiring polished presence

**Evening Glamour:**
- Stunning with formal gowns and cocktail dresses
- Beautiful accent for wedding guest attire
- Perfect for galas, premieres, and special celebrations

### Care Instructions

Emeralds require special care due to their natural characteristics:

- **Daily Wear**: Remove before washing hands, applying lotion, or physical activities
- **Cleaning**: Use only lukewarm water and mild soap; pat dry gently
- **Storage**: Store separately in soft pouch to prevent scratches
- **Avoid**: Ultrasonic cleaners, steam cleaning, harsh chemicals, sudden temperature changes
- **Professional Care**: Annual inspection recommended

### Emerald Enhancement Note

Like most emeralds worldwide, these stones have received minor clarity enhancement (oiling), a traditional and accepted practice dating back centuries. This enhancement is stable with proper care and does not affect long-term beauty or value.

### Investment Value

Fine Colombian emeralds are among the world's most valuable gemstones, with prices rising steadily due to decreasing supply and increasing global demand. These earrings represent both exquisite beauty and sound investment.
